                        <h2>About Us</h2>
                        <p>"5 Ingredients or Less" started when two individuals, Bernice and Wesley, were interested in cooking more at home to eat healthier and spend less on takeout and going out to restaurants. But due to their busy schedules that takes away from the grocery shopping, actual cooking and the worry that they would be wasting food, it did not start until a few months ago when they found some delectable recipes that only required less than 5 ingredients. 
                        <br><br>
                        <p>When they tried cooking before this, a lot of recipes contained many ingredients but some would only need a small amount of it or it was very time-consuming to find all the ingredients needed for each recipe. For those who do not cook a lot, some of those ingredients would need to be tossed out. This is a waste of time and money.</p>
                        <br><br>
                        <p>Hence, "5 Ingredients or Less" was developed. Each recipe on our website requires very few ingredients so less will go to waste, spend less time grocery shopping and youâ€™ll be cooking a delicious meal at home. You can also save money if you plan to buy a lot of one ingredient to be used in multiple recipes on our website.</p>
                        <br><br>
                        <p>We hope you enjoy the recipes that we have compiled on this website and it'll also motivate you to cook at home more.</p>
